## Current total

(Brew kit only, no table or fermenter) = 805.01 - 1117.42
(lower price is cheaper options, minimum to get going. Larger price, expensive options, and extras)

## Extra thoughts

Motorised valves seem to be v. expensive.

Do we want to control the speed of wort through the chiller to hit a given temperature on the exit? If so +1 RTD and maybe +1 flow meter
